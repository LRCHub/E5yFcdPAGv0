I'm a man who doesn't know defeat
I tend to tower over trees
And I make a damn good coffee

I'm a man who's great at setting trends
Uses his teeth to open cans
I've never lost against a grizzly

But when it comes to you
I'm like a child
I'm stuck and won't get anywhere

I wrote Casablanca in my sleep
? To say the least
And I'm? at Ryan Gosling

But when it comes to you
I'm like a child
I'm stuck and won't get anywhere

Days like these I wish that I could just hide in my bed
Like a captain who's lost his first mate to the ocean
Some things will just never, ever change

I'm the kid who never did his chores
I've slayed a thousand dinosaurs
Yeah, I'm the cause for their extinction

I don't remember the last time I gave in
I can't recall the last party I didn't attend
I look great in a black tuxedo
Oh yeah!

But when it comes to you
I'm like a child
I'm stuck and won't get anywhere

Days like these I wish that I could just hide in my bed
Like a captain who's lost his first mate to the ocean
Some things will just never, ever change

Wake up every morning with my feet in front of me
The sun burning my eyelids making it too hard to see
I know I need to come around
It's way too late for me to win this war

I've loaded up my luggage with everything I might need
A t-shirt and a few socks, two pillows and a book to read
I'm off just like an astronaut, shuttle straight up into space
But before I leave I'll be sure that you don't forget this face

Days like these I wish that I could just hide in my bed
Like a captain who's lost his first mate to the ocean
Some things will just never, ever change
