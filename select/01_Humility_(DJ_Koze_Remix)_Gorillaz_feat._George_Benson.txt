Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you (calling you)

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

Callin' the hunter with a rifle
'Cause right now that's the ball where we be chained
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you (calling you)

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?
